<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Tags are used to define different sections of the page. I find p, ul/ol, table, and all heading tags (h1, h2, etc) the most useful at this point.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays elements in the order that they are written into the HTML page.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to create snippets in Sublime so I do not have to type out all the HTML format for everything. I will definitely be making more snippets for later (maybe a table snippet or a list).
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I found the snippet the most challenging as it was something I had zero experience with. I will improve on this by creating more snippets of my own to get familiar with how to create them.-->
