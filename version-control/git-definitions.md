# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version Control is the documentation of changes made. It is helpful if there is a bug or you do not like a change. You can see exactly when changes were made and by who.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch allows you to work on a project without altering the master copy. A branch is essentially a copy of the original work. If you like your work you can merge it back in or you can leave it separate.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Commit is a save point. A commit message is the note of what the save point is. A good commit message is one where you know exactly what stage the project is in/what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you are unable to merge a branch back into the master copy. This could be because two people edited the same branch in conflicting ways, someone deleted the branch you are trying to edit, etc.
