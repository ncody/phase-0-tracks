jQuery
-initially look up what jQuery is and why it is used as well as a basic intro(wikipedia, w3schools, etc.)
-Questions to research immediately:
  -do I need to install something to use it?
  -how do I connect my work to my HTML/CSS?
-watch some videos on jQuery because I am a visual learner (youtube, codeschool) - no more than 30 minutes of basic intro videos to see some basic connections
-start some experiments on my own to practice the basic skills I have learned from the videos. Think of things I would like to do on practice and look up how to do these on stackoverflow
-take a 10 minute break at the halfway point in the time to make sure I am engaged the entire time and let my mind rest
-This is my approach because I need to start with a very low level understanding of what it is and why it is useful before I can appreciate the code. I am following that up with videos because I notice that I learn the most from them throughout the coursework this far. Then I will repeat what I learned in videos in my own work to solidify the skills of what I was watching and continue looking things up and practicing from there.

Result: the most helpful thing for me was the combination of watching something in a video, then trying it myself, and troubleshooting from there if it didn't work
