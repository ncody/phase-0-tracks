Key design philosophies of Linux:
-Small is beautiful
-Each program does one thing well
-Prototype as soon as possible
-Choose portability over efficiency
-Store data in flat text files
-Use software leverage
-Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
-Avoid captive user interfaces
-Make every program a filter

VPS: Virtual Private Server is a piece of memory that can run its own operating system remotely(virtually).
-Advantages:the user has full access to the operating system, the VPS can host multiple sites, cheaper than a server

Root user issues: any bug or virus could completely destroy your system when working in root. Root should be used as a security measure. Additionally, root does not verify actions with the user that could be harmful but the user level does.
